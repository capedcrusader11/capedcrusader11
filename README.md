An experienced solidity developer with expertise in understanding  and delivering software solutions based on business requirements.

My interest lies in **NFTs, Marketplaces, Decentralised Finance** and **Blockchain development** in general.

I am an expert in Solidity for smart contract development and have also done smart contract auditing which helps me to write optimized and secure contracts.

I have deep knowledge around the various token standards like **ERC1155, ERC721, ERC20** and I have working experience with standards like **EIP2771** and **EIP712** for **metatransactions**.

I have been writing upgradeable contracts for a long time and have specific knowledge in that area after using both **Transparent proxy** and **UUPS proxies**.

I have also implemented **diamond proxies(EIP2535)** to eliminate the size limit on a solidity contract.

When it comes to Full stack web development, I have worked in backend technologies like **Node.js** and **ROR**.

My expertise lies in frontend technologies with **React.js.**
